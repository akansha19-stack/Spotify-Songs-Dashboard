I have created this Spotify Popular Songs Dashboard by using relevant
KPIs to show total streams, artist count, songs played on a particular
playlist like spotify, apple and deezer playlist. To showcase all these playlist in
a single visual i have used a line chart to show the trend of all the three playlists.
I have also used filters to show top 10 tracks, top 10 artists by streams, bpm(beats per minute),
dancebility to filter out most played tracks and most streamed artist.
